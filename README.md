# pi-advisor - Advisor Extension for pi

A [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension that restricts the agent to read-only codebase exploration. The agent can only write to `PI_ADVISOR_NOTES.md`, acting as an advisor that explores, analyzes, and documents findings.

I created this extension to use in personal projects where I often want to have full control over the codebase. It's not dissimilar to the plan mode available in other agents like opencode, with the exception of pi-advisor being geared toward explanation rather than preparing to execute code changes. 

Full disclosure: this extension was created with GLM-5.1 using pi after providing a detailed specification.

I hope you find it useful.

## What It Does

- Restricts the agent to read-only tools: `read`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`
- Replaces `write` and `edit` with `advisor_write` and `advisor_edit` that only target `PI_ADVISOR_NOTES.md`
- Blocks destructive bash commands (file modification, package managers, git writes, privilege escalation, etc.)
- Builds a minimal system prompt with only the sections the advisor needs
- Starts in advisor mode and can toggle back to regular agent mode
- Requires approval in regular agent mode before any `write` or `edit`, and before any bash command that is not classified as read-only
- Shows "ADVISOR" or "AGENT" in the status line

## Installation

For local development:

```bash
pi -e ./pi-advisor/src/index.ts
```

To install from a git repository containing this package, add it to your settings:

```json
{
  "packages": ["git:github.com/john-marinelli/pi-advisor"]
}
```

Or try temporarily:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/john-marinelli/pi-advisor
```

## Usage

Once loaded, the agent starts in advisor mode automatically:

1. Ask the agent to explore the codebase or answer questions
2. The agent reads files and runs read-only commands
3. When asked to, pi-advisor can document the conversation in `PI_ADVISOR_NOTES.md` in the current working directory

Toggle modes with the `/advisor` command:

```text
/advisor          # Toggle between advisor and regular agent mode
/advisor on       # Enable advisor mode
/advisor off      # Restore regular agent mode
/advisor status   # Show the current mode
```

Regular agent mode restores the normal system prompt and the normal tool set for the session. The selected mode is saved in the session, so resuming that session restores the last selected mode.

While advisor mode is off, pi-advisor still adds a safety gate:

- `write` always asks for approval
- `edit` always asks for approval
- `bash` asks for approval unless the command is classified as read-only

In non-interactive modes where confirmation UI is unavailable, these mutating actions are blocked instead of running silently.

## Allowed vs Blocked

These restrictions apply only while advisor mode is enabled:

| Action | Allowed in advisor mode |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Read any file | Yes |
| Run read-only bash commands | Yes |
| Write to `PI_ADVISOR_NOTES.md` | Yes |
| Edit `PI_ADVISOR_NOTES.md` | Yes |
| Write to any other file | No |
| Run destructive bash commands | No |

When advisor mode is disabled, normal tools are restored, but mutating operations still require approval first.
